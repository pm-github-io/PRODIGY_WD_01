A responsive landing page is a web page designed to adapt and display correctly across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience. The page typically consists of several key elements:

1. **Header**: This section usually contains the branding or logo of the website along with navigation links to other parts of the site.

2. **Main Content**: This area contains the primary content of the landing page, such as an introduction to the product or service being promoted, key features, benefits, and any call-to-action elements like buttons or forms.

3. **Footer**: The footer typically includes additional links, legal information, copyright notices, and sometimes contact information.

To make the landing page responsive, CSS media queries are commonly used. Media queries allow different styles to be applied based on the characteristics of the device, such as its screen width. For example, on smaller screens like mobile phones, elements may stack vertically to conserve space, while on larger screens like desktop monitors, elements may be arranged side by side.

JavaScript can also be used to enhance the functionality of the landing page, such as implementing interactive elements or dynamic content loading. However, it's important to ensure that JavaScript usage doesn't compromise the performance or accessibility of the page.
